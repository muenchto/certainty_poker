# Rules of the Game

*CertaintyPoker is a game a bout guessing and estimating the quality of one's guess in the face of changing information. These are the rules of the game:*

1. CertaintyPoker can be played by an arbitrary number of players. Players are seated around a table. At the beginning of the game, one player is randomly assigned the "anchor" (in poker this player is called the "dealer") and holds an anchor button indicating this status.

2. Each player has a certain amount of __money__. When the game starts, all player have the same amount of money. During the game, players win and loose money.

3. CertaintyPoker is played in multiple __rounds__.

4. Each round has one __question__. Typically the answer of the question is unknown to most people, but can be guessed somehow. The __answer__ to a question is always a number. Examples for such questions are: *How many kilometers highway does Germany have?* Or: *What is the price of 1 kg of (cheapest) salt in a discounter in Paris (in â‚¬)?*, *What is the average life expectancy amongst women in Ghana in the year 2018?*

5. Besides the answer, every question also has a number of __hints__. Typically, a hint provides information which make it easier to assess the quality of a guess. Regarding the question of female life expectancy in Ghana from above, hints could be something like: *The overall (both genders) life expectancy in Nigeria in the year 2018 was 53.4 years.* or *The life expectancy of men in Ghana in the year of 2018 was 62.4 years.*  (However, the quality of the hints can differ, and sometimes the hint might not even contain any valuable information at all.)

6. At the beginning of each round, the player next to the anchor player has to place a minimum bet called __small blind__. The player next to the small blind has to place a bet double of the small blind, the __big blind__.

7. Now the players are presented the question of this round. They then write down their guess of the answer, and keep their guess hidden to the other players.

8. Now the __betting__ begins. Betting means that players put some (or all) of their money in front of them. The betting has the following rules:

    1. Players bet in turns, one after another, starting with the player next to the player who placed the big blind. Only players who are still in the game (i.e. they are not out) participate in the betting.

    2. Whenever a player puts all their money in the pot, they are said to have gone __all in__.

    3. At their turn, a player has several options:

        1. They can __leave__ (in poker, this is called "folding"). That means they are __out of the round__, i.e. they do not participate in that round any more, and they have no chance to win the pot. All money the player has bet in this round, is lost to them.

        2. They can __call__. This means that they place the maximum bet in front of themselves. If a player is not able to set the maximum bet (because it exceeds the amount of money the player has left), they can call by going all in. In case a player has already set the maximum bet, them calling is called __check__.

        3. They can __raise__. This means that they put more money than current the maximum bet in front of themselves.

9. The betting ends whenever either all players but one have left or all players in a row have checked.

10. After the betting, a new hint is unveiled to the players, and another betting starts. This procedure repeats, until all the hints of the question have been unveiled.

11. After the last hint has been unveiled and the last betting has been done, the __showdown__ starts: First the answer of the question is unveiled to the players. Now, one after another, starting from the player still in the round and most next to the anchor player, each player can either leave the round (and do not unveil their guess) or __show__ their guess.

12. After all players have either shown their guess or left the round, the __pot__ is distributed to the players who have shown their guess. [TODO: Describe distribution of pot and definition of side pots and main pot.]

13. After that, the round is finished. All players who do not have any money left now, are __out of the game__ and cannot participate in further rounds of the game. The anchor button moves to the player who sits next to the current anchor still in the game. A new round begins.

14. The game is over if either all players but one are out or no questions are left. In the first case, the only remaining player is the winner of the game, in the second case, the player with the most money is the winner of the game. (If multiple players have the same amount of money, and no other individual player has more money, those players are all winners of the game.)
